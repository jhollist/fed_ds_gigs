# Fed Data Science Gigs

I will do my best to keep this list of data science positions with the federal goverment up to date, but do not consider this exhaustive.  It is mostly as I hear about recruitments.  

Also, if anyone who stumbled across this is considering applying and has questions about the process, wants feedback on resumes, etc. just open an issue.  No promises that we can find someone to take a look, but I have a few folks who might be able to carve out some time.  In other words, no harm in asking for a hand with the federal hiring process and I will see if we can find someone to take a look!

Note: The official Data Science classification is fairly new and not all agencies have been quick to use it, so data science jobs may be hidden behind another series.
